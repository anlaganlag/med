# Project Scratchpad

## Background and Motivation
The project involves splitting a PRDv1.md document into two separate files:
1. Moving all acceptance-related content from PRDv1.md to a new file called acceptance.md
2. Updating PRDv1.md to have the remaining content without the acceptance sections

## Key Challenges and Analysis
- Need to identify all acceptance-related content in PRDv1.md
- Create a new acceptance.md file with extracted content
- Update PRDv1.md to remove the acceptance-related content
- Ensure both files have proper formatting and structure

## High-level Task Breakdown
1. Read PRDv1.md to understand its structure and identify acceptance-related sections
2. Create acceptance.md with all acceptance-related content
3. Create an updated version of PRDv1.md with acceptance content removed
4. Verify the content of both files is correct

## Project Status Board
- [ ] Read PRDv1.md and identify acceptance-related content
- [ ] Create acceptance.md with acceptance-related content
- [ ] Update PRDv1.md to remove acceptance-related content
- [ ] Verify file contents are correctly separated

## Current Status / Progress Tracking
In progress: Initial assessment of files

## Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests
Need to review PRDv1.md first to understand what content needs to be moved.
