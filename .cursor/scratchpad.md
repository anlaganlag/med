# Project Scratchpad

## Background and Motivation
The current task is to evaluate two key project documents:
1.  **`PRDv1(2).md`**: The Product Requirements Document detailing features for an AI-assisted hemodialysis system.
2.  **`acceptance.md`**: The Acceptance Document outlining how the implemented features will be verified.
The goal is to assess their quality, completeness, consistency, and alignment to ensure a solid foundation for development and testing.

## Key Challenges and Analysis
This section will summarize the evaluation of both documents.

### Evaluation of Requirements Document (`PRDv1(2).md`)

**Strengths:**
*   **Comprehensive Structure:** Well-organized with sections covering overview, detailed functions, feasibility, project planning, technical design, risks, and benefits.
*   **Clear Objectives & Scope:** Clearly defines project background, functional scope (initial orders, temporary orders, dialysis summary), and target users.
*   **Detailed Functional Descriptions:** Each main function includes descriptions, workflow diagrams, input/output specs, features, and business rules.
*   **Prioritization:** Requirements are prioritized within the document and in phased development.
*   **Embedded Acceptance Criteria:** Functional sections include specific acceptance criteria (accuracy, performance, UX).
*   **Thorough Project Planning:** Includes workload estimates, milestones, critical path, buffered timelines, Gantt chart, and resource points.
*   **Technical Implementation Detail:** Covers tech stack, architecture, data flow, and AI model selection strategy.
*   **Risk Assessment:** Comprehensive risk analysis with mitigation strategies.
*   **Benefit & Metric Definition:** Clearly outlines expected benefits and evaluation metrics.

**Areas for Potential Improvement:**
*   **Major Inconsistency in Section 2.2:** The section for "AI辅助医生生成临时医嘱" (2.2) appears to incorrectly contain content (workflow, inputs, outputs, acceptance criteria) for "AI辅助护士生成透析小结". The detailed requirements for temporary orders are missing or misplaced. This is a critical issue.
*   **Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs):** While some NFRs are touched upon, a dedicated, more comprehensive section could be beneficial.
*   **Data Dictionary/Glossary:** A glossary for medical terms and data points could improve clarity.
*   **Details on External System APIs:** More specific details on API interactions for system integration could be added or flagged for detailed design.

### Evaluation of Acceptance Document (`acceptance.md`)

**Strengths:**
*   **Clear Structure and Process:** Well-organized with defined scope, objectives, team roles, and a clear acceptance process (including flowchart).
*   **Attempted Traceability:** Restates functional descriptions and uses diagrams to link to requirements.
*   **Specific Acceptance Criteria:** Provides tables with criteria, methods, and expected results.
*   **Comprehensive Deliverables List:** Includes software, documentation, and data deliverables with acceptance standards.
*   **Detailed Test Plan:** Outlines environment, example test cases (JSON format is good), data requirements, and schedule.
*   **Robust Issue Tracking & Sign-off:** Defines issue classification, resolution workflow, and a formal sign-off process with templates.

**Areas for Potential Improvement:**
*   **Direct Traceability Links:** Explicitly reference PRD section numbers for each acceptance criterion.
*   **Impact of PRD Inconsistency:** The missing/incorrect section in the PRD for temporary orders hinders full validation of the corresponding acceptance criteria in `acceptance.md`.
*   **Clarity of Quantitative Criteria:** Some criteria (e.g., "数据相似度") need more specific measurement methods. The stated "初始医嘱准确率 ≥75%" in acceptance is much lower than the PRD's "≥95%".
*   **Test Case Quantity Clarification:** The mention of "10 test cases" seems low; clarification that the full set is in an appendix is good, but the number in the main text could be misleading.
*   **Non-Functional Testing Detail:** Could benefit from more explicit scenarios for security, load testing, etc.
*   **Alignment of Acceptance Thresholds with PRD:** Significant discrepancies exist between acceptance thresholds in `acceptance.md` and `PRDv1(2).md` (e.g., accuracy for initial orders is 75% in acceptance vs. 95% in PRD; dialysis summary completeness 90% vs 98%). These need reconciliation.

### Overall Alignment and Quality
*   **General Quality:** Both documents are detailed and well-structured.
*   **Critical PRD Issue:** The primary concern is the content mix-up in PRD Section 2.2, which affects both documents.
*   **Criteria Discrepancy:** Acceptance criteria values differ significantly between the two documents.

## High-level Task Breakdown (Recommendations)
1.  **[CRITICAL][DONE] Correct `PRDv1(2).md` Section 2.2:**
    *   **Action:** Revise Section 2.2 of `PRDv1(2).md` to accurately detail requirements for "AI辅助医生生成临时医嘱" (workflow, inputs, outputs, features, rules, specific acceptance criteria).
    *   **Action:** Move the current content of PRD 2.2 (related to dialysis summary) to a new, appropriate section (e.g., 2.3, as `acceptance.md` already has a section 2.3 for summaries).
    *   **Success Criteria:** PRD correctly and fully details all three core AI functions with no content mismatch.
    *   **Actual Changes Made (Executor):**
        *   Identified misaligned content in `PRDv1(2).md` Section 2.2 (lines originally covering dialysis summary instead of temporary orders).
        *   Moved the dialysis summary content (original 2.2.2-2.2.5) to a new Section 2.3 titled "AI辅助护士生成透析小结", renumbering subsections accordingly (2.3.1 to 2.3.5).
        *   Drafted new, detailed content for Section 2.2 "AI辅助医生生成临时医嘱", including:
            *   2.2.2 医生工作流程图 (Doctor's Workflow Diagram for temporary orders)
            *   2.2.3 输入与输出详情 (Input & Output Details for temporary orders)
            *   2.2.4 功能特点与要求 (Functional Features & Requirements for temporary orders)
            *   2.2.5 业务规则与限制 (Business Rules & Limitations for temporary orders)
            *   2.2.6 功能验收标准 (Functional Acceptance Criteria for temporary orders)
        *   Ensured the structure and detail level of the new Section 2.2 are consistent with Section 2.1.
2.  **Align Acceptance Criteria:**
    *   **Action:** Review and reconcile all quantitative acceptance criteria between `PRDv1(2).md` and `acceptance.md`. Ensure `acceptance.md` targets meet or exceed PRD targets, or provide clear rationale for differences.
    *   **Success Criteria:** All acceptance criteria are consistent and logically aligned between the two documents.
3.  **Enhance Traceability in `acceptance.md`:**
    *   **Action:** Add direct references (e.g., PRD Section X.Y.Z) from acceptance tests in `acceptance.md` back to the specific requirements in `PRDv1(2).md`.
    *   **Success Criteria:** Clear and unambiguous traceability is established.
4.  **Clarify Measurement Methods in `acceptance.md`:**
    *   **Action:** For any qualitative or ambiguous acceptance criteria (e.g., "数据相似度"), specify the precise measurement methodology.
    *   **Success Criteria:** All acceptance criteria are objectively measurable.
5.  **Review and Finalize Non-Functional Testing Scope:**
    *   **Action:** Detail the scope and specific test scenarios for non-functional aspects (security, performance, scalability, usability) in the acceptance plan.
    *   **Success Criteria:** Non-functional testing scope is clearly defined and adequate.

## Lessons
*   Maintaining consistency between detailed requirements (PRD) and their corresponding acceptance criteria (Acceptance Document) is crucial. Thresholds and metrics should align.
*   Clear, unambiguous definitions and measurement methods for acceptance criteria prevent misinterpretation during testing.
*   Workflow diagrams and detailed I/O specifications in requirements documents are highly beneficial.
*   For complex features, especially AI-driven ones, detailed acceptance criteria for accuracy, performance, and specific functional behaviors are essential.
*   Careful document review can catch structural errors (like content mix-ups) before they impact later stages.
